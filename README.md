Welcome to the **BuckSavers**, a Kotlin-based Android application designed to help users manage their monthly expenses, visualize spending habits, and stay on top of upcoming bills — all with a sleek and interactive UI built in Jetpack Compose.

---

## 🎯 App Purpose

- 📊 Track income and expenses per category
- 📅 Stay ahead of upcoming bills

## 🧭 Navigation Walkthrough

The app uses a bottom navigation bar (except on login/register screens) to switch between core features. Here's how to navigate:

### 🏁 Getting Started

1. **Splash Screen**
   - Automatically redirects to login after a brief display

2. **Login**
   - Enter username and password
   - If already registered, user is logged in
   - If not, registration logic checks for duplicates and hashes password

> 🔐 Bottom nav is hidden here to prevent bypassing security

- **MVVM architecture** for clean separation of logic
- **Secure authentication** with hashed password handling using BCrypt
- **StateFlow + Compose** for reactive UI updates

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or extract the project.
2. Add this dependency to your `build.gradle.kts`:
   ```kotlin
   implementation("org.mindrot:jbcrypt:0.4")
   ```
3. Sync Gradle.
4. Run on emulator or device (API level 26+ recommended).

## 🛠 Developer Tips

- All navigation routes include `userId` for user-specific views.
- `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` is enabled — safe for prototyping.
- Ensure to call `viewModel.loadExpenses(userId)` before showing data-dependent screens.
