**Bucksavers mobile budget tracking app**

The aim of this project was to create a functional prototype of a budget tracking app in Android Studio using Kotlin and Jetpack libraries. 
As a team, we have worked together to create a functional prototype with a working database and innovative features.

The following features were included in the prototype:
1. Sign up and Login
2. Setting a monthly budget
3. Adding expenses that are categorized per expense as well as enabling users to create their own category
4. A home page displaying the users monthly budget along with their expenses and upcoming payments
5. A stats page containing a breakdown of the users expenses per category
6. A rewards page containing a tier system based on the users monthly savings
7. A profile page displaying the users remaining budget along with their uploaded profile photo
8. Finally a logout feature in the profile screen
