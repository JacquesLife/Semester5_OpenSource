**Bucksavers Mobile Budget Tracking App**

The aim of this project was to create a functional prototype of a budget tracking app in Android Studio using Kotlin and Jetpack libraries. 
As a team, we have worked together to create a functional prototype with a working database and innovative features.

The following features were included in the prototype:
1. Sign up and Login
2. Setting a monthly budget
3. Adding expenses that are categorized per expense as well as enabling users to create their own category
4. A home page displaying the users monthly budget along with their expenses and upcoming payments
5. A stats page containing a breakdown of the users expenses per category
6. A rewards page containing a tier system based on the users monthly savings
7. A profile page displaying the users remaining budget along with their uploaded profile photo
8. Finally a logout feature in the profile screen

**Bucksavers Navigation**

Once the user has opened the application, they will be greeted with the sign up and log in page. The user will be prompted to create an account by entering a username and password. Once they have completed this, they will be able to sign up and log in. Once they have selected the login button they will be prompted to enter their monthly income. Along with entering their monthly income, they are required to enter their monthly maximum spending goal along with their mimimum savings goal. Once the user has successfully submitted their budget goals, they will be greeted by the Home page. 

The Home page displays the users Total balance, Upcoming bills and Bills paid. It also displays the upcoming bills per expense along with the expenses category, date and amount. The user is able to select the Transactions button and view the expenses that have been paid. 

To navigate to the Add expense page, Stats page, Rewards page and Profile page, the user must make use of the navigation bar at the bottom of the Bucksavers application. 

The + icon in blue in the navigation bar will take the user to the Add expense page. Here the user will be able to select a category or create one, enter the amount for their selected/created category, enter the date for their expense and add and image. Once they have completed this, they are able to select the "Add Expense" button.

The bar graph icon in the navigation bar will take the user to the Stats page. The Stats page contains a pie chart which displays the % each category of the total monthly expenses. If the user scrolls down on the page they will be able to view their upcoming payments. 

The wallet icon in the navigation bar will take the user to the Rewards page. The Rewards page contains different tiers with point allocations. The user is able to achive points by budgeting efficiently. The users are able to progress through the tiers by accumulating points.

The profile icon in the navigation bar will take the users to the Profile page. The Profile Page contains the users profile photo, username, tier rank, total budget and remaining budget. Here the user is also able to log out of the application by clicking on the "Logout" button.
